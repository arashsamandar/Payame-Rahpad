            Hello and Welcome to my Personal Website.
            My name is arash. i am 35 yrs old freelancer<br>
            i started programming when i was 13 and of course after i studied computer hardware ( A+ ).
            i am a self taught programmer and developer though i have worked and made apps for government and i was
            working there for 6 or more years . but i have always learned by myself as unfortunately my family had problem
            and my parents divorced. i have even jumped some school when i couldn't go to . i just studied myself and then
            i participate in exams and pass, that is of course for mid level high school.
            after that i thought myself computer ( windows was new at that time ) . then as i said hardware by reading
            thick english books :) , and that is how i learned English too :) . i am not very good at speaking though as
            i have never attended any class and i am lonely most of the times i don't have many foreign friends.
            after that i wrote some action-scripts ( for flash at that time ) for advertising a pyramid company which was hot at that time.
            though i didn't get anywhere there :) . then i entered college for `Computer Software Engineering` and i have passed almost half
            or more of my units i had in college for becoming graduate. ( i left college half way ) to put my focus in work that i had found
            at that time when my colleague which was the chairman of IT Consultant messaged me for the first time in facebook and he was looking
            for a teacher that could teach ICDL to employees , i didn't get hired for teaching, but anyway that was how i got familiar with web and mobile
            technologies ( software research and development ). and it really helped me put my studies that i had in college to practice.
            the reset as the say is history :) and i have wrote about it more in `LinkedIn`.
